# Gesture-Controlled-IoT-based-Robot-
A gesture-controlled IoT-based robot is a robotic system that can be controlled through hand gestures and movements, offering a seamless and user-friendly interaction experience. Our project showcases the potential of integrating gesture control with IoT to create smart, responsive systems.
The application of gesture-controlled IoT-based robots in healthcare spans various critical domains, enhancing patient care, therapy sessions, and hospital operations. These robots serve as versatile tools for remote patient monitoring, allowing healthcare providers to navigate hospital wards, monitor vital signs, and provide timely assistance. 
A prototype of the gesture-controlled IoT-based robot has been developed, following the direction given by commonly known patterns. It follows five different gestures made by hand to perform its directional movement. 
1.	Stop/Steady: when it gets a hand gesture that is parallel with horizontal.
2.	Front/Forward: when it gets a hand gesture that creates the highest -90 degree in the Y axis.
3.	Rear: when it gets a hand gesture that creates the highest +90 degree in the Y axis.
4.	Left: when it gets a hand gesture that creates the highest -90 degree in the X axis.
5.	Right: when it gets a hand gesture that creates the highest +90 degree in the X axis.
